# Small N Stats Bayesian Model Selector
Bayesian Model Selector is a WPF application that uses R interop libraries (RdotNet) to easily facilitate many complex calculations, including the fitting of multiple models of intertemporal choice as well as a bayesian model comparison method, using a friendly spreadsheet-based approach.  

Features include:
  - Non-linear model fittings (Exponential, Hyperbolic, Quasi-Hyperbolic/b-d, and both Hyperboloid Variants)
  - Bayesian Model comparison/competition using Bayesian information criterion (BIC) to inform the best/better fitting models (see Franck et al., 2015)
  - ED50 calculations for all models, all parameter fittings, and overall model competition (e.g., best, 2nd best, ...)
  - Identification of best performing model, with corresponding ED50, for similar cross-model discounting indices
  - R-based graphical output in appropriate log space(s) for each model selected (ggplot2)
  - Easily imports common file formats into the application's spreadsheet (.xlsx, .csv)
  - Wide range of model outputs/metrics, saveable in common spreadsheet file formats

### Installation
You will need the R open-source statistical package for model fitting/charting to be performed.
Once Bayesian Model Selector is installed, it will perform a one-time install the necessary R packages (internet required).
Bayesian Model Selector is a ClickOnce application, the program will automatically update as the program is refined.

### Download
All downloads, if/when posted, will be hosted at [Small N Stats](http://www.smallnstats.com/BayesianSelector.html). 

### Development
Want to contribute? Great! Emails or PM's are welcome.

### Todos
 - Completed! Scheduled for public release late May 2016

### Acknowledgements and Credits
The Bayesian Model Simulator uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
* R - The open-sourced statistical package
* Reogrid Spreadsheet - A free spreadsheet view component for use in WPF projects
* RdotNet - A R interop library facilitating a C# bridge to the R binaries
* nls Package for R: Curve-fitting methods
* ggplot2 Package for R: Grammar of graphics charting methods


### Installation
You need the R open-source statistical package for calculations to be performed.  

The application itself is a ClickOnce application, enabling seamless updates as the program is refined.
